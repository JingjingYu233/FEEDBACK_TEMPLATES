# Team Feedback on lab05 for ____TEAM NAME GOES HERE____

## Rubric for y/n/? items

Mentors will use a y/n/? rubric to provided feedback on some items.  Here is the interpretation

| item | interpretation |
|------|-----------------|
| y | definitely yes: any reasonable person would agree that the submitted work meets the criteria |
| n | definitely no: no reasonable person would see even a partial credit worthy attempt at meeting the criteria |
| ? | somewhere in-between. In this case, mentor should make notes, and TA should pay particularly attention to the item when grading |


## Team Mentor Reviewed items

Mentor: You need to look in two places

1. In the `_REVIEW` repo of the partner team (see: [partner team chart](https://ucsb-cs48.github.io/w19/images/team review.png)), for example
   since Ray from `4pm-turkey-trot` reviwed `4pm-gold-scheduler`, look in <https://github.com/ucsb-cs48-w19/4pm-gold-scheduler_REVIEWS/blob/master/lab05_reviewer.md> for Ray's review of Gold Scheduler.
2. In your OWN team`s `_REVIEW` repo for the reviewee report; for example, if your team is `4pm-turkey-trot`, look in <https://github.com/ucsb-cs48-w19/4pm-turkey-trot_REVIEWS/blob/master/lab05_reviewee.md>
