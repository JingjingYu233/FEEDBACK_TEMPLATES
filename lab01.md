# Feedback on lab01.md

## Rubric for y/n/? items

Mentors will use a y/n/? rubric to provided feedback on some items.  Here is the interpretation

| item | interpretation |
|------|-----------------|
| y | definitely yes: any reasonable person would agree that the submitted work meets the criteria |
| n | definitely no: no reasonable person would see even a partial credit worthy attempt at meeting the criteria |
| ? | somewhere in-between. In this case, mentor should make notes, and TA should pay particularly attention to the item when grading |

## Mentor Checklist

Note that if the evaluation is made many days after the original due date, the situation on the Kanban board may have changed. 
Mentors and TAs, please take that into account, and use the log of events on issues to try to determine, as best you can, whether
the spirit of the assignment has been met. 

Ideally, every team member should be assigned to at least one in progress issue at all times.

For purposes of this evaluation of the last item in the table below:
* if a team member is *currently* assigned to an IN-PROGRESS issue, that's good enough
* if a team member is *not* currently assigned to an issue, but it can be determined that they were assigned to one by the due date, 
   and it was subsesquently completed, that's ok too.
   * though in that case, a reminder to pull a new issue may be in order
