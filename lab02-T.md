# Team Feedback on lab02.md for ____TEAM NAME GOES HERE____

## Rubric for y/n/? items

Mentors will use a y/n/? rubric to provided feedback on some items.  Here is the interpretation

| item | interpretation |
|------|-----------------|
| y | definitely yes: any reasonable person would agree that the submitted work meets the criteria |
| n | definitely no: no reasonable person would see even a partial credit worthy attempt at meeting the criteria |
| ? | somewhere in-between. In this case, mentor should make notes, and TA should pay particularly attention to the item when grading |


## Team Graded items
