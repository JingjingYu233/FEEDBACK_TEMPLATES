# Team Feedback on lab08 for ____TEAM NAME GOES HERE____

## Rubric for y/n/? items

Mentors will use a y/n/? rubric to provided feedback on some items.  Here is the interpretation

| item | interpretation |
|------|-----------------|
| y | definitely yes: any reasonable person would agree that the submitted work meets the criteria |
| n | definitely no: no reasonable person would see even a partial credit worthy attempt at meeting the criteria |
| ? | somewhere in-between. In this case, mentor should make notes, and TA should pay particularly attention to the item when grading |


## Team Mentor Reviewed items

Mentor: Please review checklist below, with someone from the team
watching and recording items on slack that might need to be adjusted.



| Item                                                        | Response | 
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|  Look over the README.md.  Is it in final polished form?    |          |
|  README instructions for installing. Try them. Do they work?|          |
|  Product features; do they all work?                        |          |
|  Look at the code.   Is it straightforward to understand?   |          |
|  Does it follow reasonably good coding practices?           |          |
|  Is there at least some automated unit/integration testing? |          |
|  Is that testing automated via Travis/CI?                   |          |


Mentor: If n or ?, explain.
