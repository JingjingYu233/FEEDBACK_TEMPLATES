# Team Feedback on lab08 for ____TEAM NAME GOES HERE____

## Rubric for y/n/? items

Mentors will use a y/n/? rubric to provided feedback on some items.  Here is the interpretation

| item | interpretation |
|------|-----------------|
| y | definitely yes: any reasonable person would agree that the submitted work meets the criteria |
| n | definitely no: no reasonable person would see even a partial credit worthy attempt at meeting the criteria |
| ? | somewhere in-between. In this case, mentor should make notes, and TA should pay particularly attention to the item when grading |


## Team Mentor Reviewed items

Mentor: Please review checklist below, with someone from the team
watching and recording items on slack that might need to be adjusted.

Are these assessments final?

At your discretion, if you want to give your team additional time to 
fix any items below and re-review them, you may.   But you are NOT obligated
to do so.   You may give any deadline between now and midnight before next week's lab,
provided that you leave yourself enough time to complete the re-review BEFORE
lab09's lab STARTS (*NOT* during next week's lab).

| Item                                                        | Response | 
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|  Look over the README.md.  Is it in final polished form?    |          |
|  README instructions for installing. Try them. Do they work?|          |
|  Product features; do they all work?                        |          |
|  Look at the code.   Is it straightforward to understand?   |          |
|  Does it follow reasonably good coding practices?           |          |
|  Is there at least some automated unit/integration testing? |          |
|  Is that testing automated via Travis/CI?                   |          |


Mentor: If n or ?, explain.
